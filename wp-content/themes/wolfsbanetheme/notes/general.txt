You will need to include the parsely javascript code after you include the jquery code. That will then extend the jquery object to have the parsely method.

If you have imported both through npm then you will need import the parsleyjs module at the top of your main entry file for you javascript before bundling it. I would recommend using webpack for the bundling.

import 'parsleyjs'
Usually jQuery can be added to your project files globally through the webpack provide plugin.

See: https://webpack.js.org/plugins/provide-plugin/

new webpack.ProvidePlugin({
  $: 'jquery',
  jQuery: 'jquery'
})
